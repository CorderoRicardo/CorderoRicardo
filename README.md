<h4>Hi, I'm @CorderoRicardo</h4>
<p>
  <em>And I'm something of a software developer myself ðŸ¤“</em><br><br> 
  I been working on web development for a while and I learned a thing or two on <strong>UI/UX</strong> as well as <strong>Node JS</strong>
  with frameworks for frontend like <em>Vue</em> or <em>SASS</em> and other libraries like <em>CodeMirror</em> and <em>Yjs</em> to achieve
  functionality. I have a badge for a MTA Certification that I want to show... ItÂ´s not much but is honest work.
